AU is a live video installation that allows viewers to experience the concept of a <em>shared present</em> between two observers separated by one astronomical unit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &plus;</summary>

<p>
Aristarchus of Samo -some 2200 years ago- roughly calculated the distance from the earth, to the moon, and the sun. His work unlocked a series of subsequent measurements that culminated in what today is referred to as the astronomical unit (au). 
<br>
<br>
The astronomical unit measures the approximate distance between the earth and the sun, which averages to roughly 150 million kilometers depending on the time of the year it is measured. This large number is easier to digest as 499 light/seconds, or the time it takes light to travel said distance. 
<br>
<br>
Because of this, today we know it is impossible for two observers -separated by a large distance- to experience the same event in real time. In other words, they can’t share the same present.
<br>
<br>
<em>AU</em> utilises a rudimentary video setup to simulate a real-time present in two locations separated by one astronomical unit. Viewers can simultaneously observe a live subject, and a live video feed of the same subject 499 seconds (8.3 minutes) in the past. This delay equals the time it would take the light reflected from the subject to reach an observer 150 million kilometers away.
